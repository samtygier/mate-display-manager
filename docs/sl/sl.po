The PAM modules determine what prompts (if any) are shown to the user to authenticate. On the average system, the greeter program will request a username and password for authentication. However some systems may be configured to use alternative mechanisms such as a fingerprint or SmartCard reader.

By default, GDM is configured to display a face browser so the user can select their user account by clicking on an image instead of having to type their username.

These scripts are provided as hooks for distributions and end-users to customize how sessions are managed. For example, using these hooks you could set up a machine which creates the user's $HOME directory on the fly, and erases it on logout. The difference between the <filename>PostLogin</filename> and <filename>PreSession</filename> scripts is that <filename>PostLogin</filename> is run before the pam_open_session call so is the right place to do anything which should be run before the user session is initialized.

Then use GDM to the point where it fails, and debug output will be sent to the system log file (<filename>&lt;var&gt;/log/messages</filename> or <filename>&lt;var&gt;/adm/messages</filename> depending on your Operating System). If you share this output with the GDM community via a bug report or email, please only include the GDM related debug information and not the entire file since it can be large. If you do not see any GDM syslog output, you may need to configure syslog (refer to the <ulink type=\"help\" url=\"man:syslog\">syslog</ulink> man page)."

Refer to your Xserver error log for an idea of what the problem may be. The problem may also be that your Xserver requires different command-line options.
