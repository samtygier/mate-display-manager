msgid "The greeter program is run as the unpriviledged \"gdm\" user/group. This user and group are described in the \"Security\" section of this document. The main function of the greeter program is to authenticate the user. The authentication process is driven by Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). The PAM modules determine what prompts (if any) are shown to the user to authenticate. On the average system, the greeter program will request a username and password for authentication. However some systems may be configured to use alternative mechanisms such as a fingerprint or SmartCard reader. GDM and PAM can be configured to not require any input, which will cause GDM to automatically log in and simply start a session, which can be useful for some environments, such as for kiosks."
msgstr "Il programma greeter è eseguito con i pemessi senza privilegi dell'utente/gruppo \"gdm\". Tale utente e gruppo sono descritti nella sezione \"Sicurezza\" di questo documento. La funzione principale del programma greeter è quella di autenticare gli utenti. Il processo di autenticazione è guidato da PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules). I moduli PAM determinano se e quali prompt sono mostrati all'utente per autenticarsi. Su un sistema tipico, il programma greeter richiede nome utente e password per l'autenticazione. Alcuni sistemi potrebbero però essere configurati per usare meccanismi alternativi come lettori di impronte digitali o SmartCard. GDM e PAM possono essere configurati per non richiedere alcun imput, nel qual caso GDM effettua automaticamente l'accesso e semplicemente avvia una sessione, comportamento utile per alcuni ambienti come i chioschi."

Sessions are defined by files that end in the .desktop suffix and more information about these files can be found in the \"Configuration\" section of this document. By default, GDM is configured to display a face browser so the user can select their user account by clicking on an image instead of having to type their username. GDM keeps track of the user's default session and language in the user's <filename>~/.dmrc</filename> and will use these defaults if the user did not pick a session or language in the login GUI."
msgstr "In aggiunta all'autenticazione, il programma greeter consente all'utente di selezionare quale sessione avviare e quale lingua usare. Le sessioni sono definite da file che terminano con il suffisso .desktop; maggiori informazioni sul questi file sono presenti nella sezione «Configurazione» di questo documento. In modo prefinito GDM è configurato per mostrare un \"face browser\" in modo che l'utente possa selezionare il proprio account facendo clic su un'immagine invece che digitando il proprio nome utente. GDM mantiene traccia della sessione e della lingua predefinita degli utente nei file <filename>~/.dmrc</filename> e fa uso di tali valori predefiniti se l'utente non sceglie una sessione o una ligua al momento dell'accesso."

msgid "After authenticating a user, the daemon runs the <filename>PostLogin</filename> script as root, then runs the <filename>PreSession</filename> script as root. After running these scripts, the user session is started. When the user exits their session, the <filename>PostSession</filename> script is run as root. These scripts are provided as hooks for distributions and end-users to customize how sessions are managed. For example, using these hooks you could set up a machine which creates the user's $HOME directory on the fly, and erases it on logout. The difference between the <filename>PostLogin</filename> and <filename>PreSession</filename> scripts is that <filename>PostLogin</filename> is run before the pam_open_session call so is the right place to do anything which should be run before the user session is initialized. The <filename>PreSession</filename> script is called after session initialization."
msgstr "Dopo aver autenticato un utente, il demone esegue lo script <filename>PostLogin</filename> come root, quindi lo script <filename>PreSession</filename> come root. Dopo l'esecuzione di questi script viene avviata la sessione utente. Quando l'utente termina la propria sessione, viene eseguito lo script <filename>PostSession</filename> come root. Tali script sono forniti come agganci per i distributori e gli utenti finali al fine di personalizzare la gestione delle sessioni. Per esempio, usando tali agganci è possibile impostare una macchina in modo da creare al volo la directory $HOME dell'utente e di eliminarla al temine della sessione. La differenza tra gli script <filename>PostLogin</filename> e <filename>PreSession</filename> risiede nel fatto che <filename>PostLogin</filename> è eseguito prima della chiamata pam_open_session, rendendolo così il posto adatto per ogni azione che debba essere eseguita prima dell'inizializzazione della sessione utente. Lo script <filename>PreSession</filename> è chiamato dopo l'inizializzazione della sessione."

Some example status icons include a battery icon for current battery usage, and an icon for enabling accessibility features. The greeter program also provides buttons which allow the user to shutdown or restart the system. It is possible to configure GDM to not provide the shutdown and restart buttons, if desired. GDM can also be configured via PolicyKit (or via RBAC on Solaris) to require the user have appropriate authorization before accepting the shutdown or restart request."

Il selettore di disposizione di tastiera inoltre cambia la disposizione usata quando si digita la propria password. Il pannello contiene anche un'area in cui i servizi di accesso possono porre le proprie icone di stato. Alcuni esempi di icone di stato includono un'icona batteria che indica l'uso attuale della batteria e un'icona per abilitare le funzioni di accesso universale.
