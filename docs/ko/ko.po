Again we'll call our example X terminal server <filename>xterminal</filename>. The setup on both servers is the same as with the case of one server in the previous section. You do not need to explicitly enable indirect queries on the server since we'll run the choosers locally on the X terminals."

You will add a server type perhaps called <filename>Chooser</filename> as follows: <screen>\n[server-Chooser]\nname=Chooser server\ncommand=/path/to/X\nflexible=false\nchooser=true\n</screen> And again this definition should in fact be included in the standard configuration file. Notice that we made the <filename>chooser</filename> key true here. This will run the XDMCP chooser for this server, and when the user chooses a host GDM will run a query for that host. Then we will define our local servers as follows: <screen>\n[servers]\n0=Chooser\n</screen>"

If the two servers are not reachable by a broadcast query, you must add them by hand to the configuration file. So in the <filename>[chooser]</filename> section you would have: <screen>\nHosts=appserverone,appservertwo\n</screen> and any other servers you wish the users to be able to connect to."

msgid "Sometimes you may want to run the chooser on the server side however. Then what you want to do is to run a configuration similar to the previous section about the one server configuration with XDMCP indirect queries enabled on <filename>appserver</filename> and on the X terminals you'd have <screen>\n[servers]\n0=Terminal -indirect appserver\n</screen> This way for example you only have to maintain one <filename>Hosts</filename> entry. However as a disadvantage then, the <filename>appserver</filename> must then always be available. So it's not good for situations where you want to have several servers and not all of them have to be on all the time. You could also have one of the X terminals handle indirect XDMCP queries and serve up the chooser to the other X terminals."
